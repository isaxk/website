<h1>Projects</h1>

<p>Here is a list and brief description of all my projects</p>

<h2 class="project-title">QuickFlags</h2>
<a href="https://flags.isaxk.com">flags.isaxk.com</a>

<p>
	QuickFlags is a speed, flag-guessing game that scores you based on how fast
	you can identify the flag, complete with account-synced stats and highscores.
</p>
<p>
    The front-end was created with SvelteKit and the account-syncing was made with Firebase.
